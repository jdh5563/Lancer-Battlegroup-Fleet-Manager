Built upon a base pattern outfitted with overlapping primary and secondary batteries, Caspian Sea-class frigates are tough and flexible multirole vessels that can hold their own both in a battle line and on solo patrol. Developed by GMS under the Second Committee during the Second Expansion Period, the Caspian Sea class has been in use for centuries thanks to ongoing platform modernization regimes. It was one of the few hulls not to be scrapped during the Third Committee's ground-up reworking of the Union Naval Department, and these frigates remain a common first posting for both regular and auxiliary navy personnel. Union naval doctrine typically designates Caspian Sea-class frigates as fire-coordination platforms and \"mainline\"-tier ships of the line.";
